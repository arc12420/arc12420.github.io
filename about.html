									<h1>About<br />
									Austin Carly</h1>
									<p>" You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine." - C. Maxwell</p>
								</header>
								<div class="imageAbout"><img class="imageAbout" src="images/Family.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Austin Carly was born and raised in Utah County, Utah. Upon graduating high school, he was unsure of the career path he wanted to take. Rather than doing nothing, he decided to serve a two-year service mission for his church. On this religious mission, he was able to develop many skills such as communication and leadership. Upon returning, Austin was still faced with the decision to choose a career. This was difficult because he didn't feel that he had a passion for any specific career choice.  What he did know at the time, was that he enjoyed working & collaborating with people.  </p>
								<p>Several years later, Austin had tested the waters with a few career options that included customer service, team lead positions, insurance and ticketing. None of those seemed to be the right fit, but throughout each of these jobs, Austin was able to realize that he really enjoyed coding within Microsoft Excel. At each of his positions, he was allowed the opportunity to create intricate Excel Spreadsheets for the company's/department's specific needs. These opportunities created a small desire to try actual coding. </p>
								<p>In Spring 2020, life took an unexpected turn due to COVID-19 when he was let go due to the shutdown. Upon losing his job, Austin decided to use the unexpected for his gain. He took the leap and began his journey towards web development by registering and completing his coding schooling. Austin attended Dev Mountain's rigorous 13-week course in web development & coding. </p>
								<p>Austin is proud to say that he has finally found his passion and is excited to get into the web development field. Just like quoted above, he finally feels like this change in his life has directed him toward success and he is eager to begin his career. </p>
